#9-16 Python Module of the Week

import random

"""The random module provides a fast pseudorandom number generator based on the Mersenne Twister algorithm. 
Originally developed to produce inputs for Monte Carlo simulations, Mersenne Twister generates numbers with 
nearly uniform distribution and a large period, making it suited for a wide range of applications."""
